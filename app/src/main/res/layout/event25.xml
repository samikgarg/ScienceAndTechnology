                android:text='Despite it being a major improvement to Savery’s version of the Steam Engine, Newcomen’s version of the steam engine also had its flaws, due to it being very inefficient. The steam cylinder, where steam pressure was converted to motion, required cooling, which required a constant flow of cool water. The cylinder also had to be reheated which required a constant source of energy. James Watt, a Scottish instrument maker employed by Glasgow University, improved the Steam Engine in 1765 by reducing its inefficiency. To achieve this, Watt made it so that the steam cylinder would be maintained with a constant temperature by creating a different condenser. The manufacture of this wasn’t able to be done immediately due to financial reasons, however, Watt was able to do so after forming a partnership with and financial backing from Matthew Boulton, an English manufacturer and engineer in 1776. Watt built a single-acting rotative steam engine featuring double power with the help of a parallel motion mechanism, alongside the separate condenser. A new gear system was also used which allowed for the conversion of linear motion into rotative motion. This system was called sun and planet gearing and was created by an employee of Watt and Boulton whose name was William Murdoch. A centrifugal governor was a device that enabled the use of the machine to control the engine’s speed. By the 1800s, this new version of the steam engine was used to power mills, factories, breweries and many other manufacturing operations across the United Kingdom and the United States (Palermo).'
